# Podman-specific overrides for rootless mode
# This file extends docker-compose.yml with Podman-specific user namespace mappings
#
# Usage:
#   podman compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.podman.yml up -d
#
# The userns_mode: keep-id setting maps the host user (e.g., UID 2000) to the
# container's node user (UID 1000), allowing proper file access to bind-mounted volumes.

services:
  openclaw-gateway:
    # Map host user to container UID 1000 (node user)
    # This allows the container to read/write to host-owned directories
    userns_mode: "keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000"

  openclaw-cli:
    # Map host user to container UID 1000 (node user)
    # This allows the container to read/write to host-owned directories
    userns_mode: "keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000"
