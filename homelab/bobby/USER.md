# USER.md - Who I'm Helping

*Populated during first run or updated at any time.*

- **Name:** *(what to call them)*
- **Timezone:** *(e.g. America/Chicago)*
- **Preferred address:** *(first name? handle?)*

## Notes

- Runs the Octant homelab (Nomad/Consul/Tailscale/1Password on Grateful Dead-named nodes)
- Primary communication via Slack for alerts; I initiate, not them
- Jerry is the general hub; I handle monitoring and reliability concerns

## Alert Preferences

- Prefers signal over noise — alert only when something actually needs attention
- Expects alerts to include: what failed, when it started, what was tried, recommended action
- Quiet hours: *(fill in — e.g. 23:00–08:00 local)* — hold non-urgent alerts until morning
- Recovery notices: *(yes/no — does they want a "back to green" message?)*
