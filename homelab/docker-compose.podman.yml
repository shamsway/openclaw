# homelab/docker-compose.podman.yml - Podman rootless overrides for homelab
#
# Extends homelab/docker-compose.yml with Podman-specific user namespace
# mappings required for rootless operation (Octant's preferred mode).
#
# The userns_mode: keep-id setting maps the host user to UID 1000 (the
# container's node user), so bind-mounted volumes are accessible to both.
#
# Usage:
#   podman compose -f homelab/docker-compose.yml \
#                  -f homelab/docker-compose.podman.yml up -d

services:
  openclaw-gateway:
    # Map host user → container UID 1000 (node user) for volume access.
    userns_mode: "keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000"
