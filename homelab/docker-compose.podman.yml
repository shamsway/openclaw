# homelab/docker-compose.podman.yml - Podman rootless overrides for homelab
#
# Extends homelab/docker-compose.yml with Podman-specific settings for
# rootless operation (Octant's preferred mode).
#
# UID/GID note: the container runs as root (uid=0). In rootless Podman,
# container uid=0 maps to the calling host user (e.g. hashi, uid=2000),
# so bind-mounted volumes are owned by the correct host user and no
# podman unshare is required. podman-compose 1.0.3 silently drops the
# userns_mode key, so --userns=keep-id is not relied upon here.
#
# Usage:
#   podman compose -f homelab/docker-compose.yml \
#                  -f homelab/docker-compose.podman.yml up -d
